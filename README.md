# DXF-DWG2GEOJSON
A simple method to help indoor mappers to convert DXF or DWG/AUTOCAD files to simple GeoJSON to display your indoor map.
Floor plans are mostly in DWG files and are not geo-referenced.
To achieve geo-referencing in AUTOCAD we have to use coordinate reference systems (CRS).

### Tools
AutoCAD
QGIS

## Procedure
In Mac 
- `Preferences` -> ``
Import your DXF/DWG file, select or group.
